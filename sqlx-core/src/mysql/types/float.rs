/// it for any real-life applications as it cannot precisely represent some fractional values,
/// and may be implicitly widened to `DOUBLE` in some cases, resulting in a slightly different
/// value:
///
/// ```rust
/// // Widening changes the equivalent decimal value, these two expressions are not equal
/// // (This is expected behavior for floating points and happens both in Rust and in MySQL)
/// assert_ne!(10.2f32 as f64, 10.2f64);
